# BRT Cap CSV Builder
This project is a tool used to build a csv for [this](https://docs.shipperhq.com/category/troubleshooting/ecommerce-platform/matrixrates/) Magento 2 utility.

The use is pretty simple, just change the rates.py file and the config.py file based on your necessity and then run main.py.

__matrixrates.ods__ is an example of output (in sheet format, not csv, as the name says).
